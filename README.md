### Testing
```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Progressive Web App testing checklist
1. **Build the production bundle**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Preview the built assets with a local HTTPS-like server** (Vite preview works without extra configuration):
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
3. **Verify the manifest**
   - Browse to `http://localhost:4173/manifest.json` and confirm the SVG icons, screenshots, `display: "standalone"`, and theme values are present.
   - In Chrome DevTools > Application > Manifest ensure the vector icons (including the maskable variant) and screenshots render without errors.
4. **Validate service worker caching**
   - In Chrome DevTools > Application > Service Workers, confirm `sw.js` is installed with the `outpaged-app-shell-v1` and runtime caches populated.
   - Switch to the **Offline** checkbox in the Network tab and reload; the offline fallback page should appear for navigations while previously loaded routes use cached data.
5. **Background sync queue retry**
   - With DevTools network throttled to "Offline", perform a POST request (e.g., via the app UI or `fetch('/api/...', { method: 'POST' })`).
   - Confirm the request is queued (visible under Application > Background Sync).
   - Re-enable the network and ensure the queued request is replayed automatically; `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` logs will confirm the replay.

### Code Quality
```bash
# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format

# Type check
npm run type-check
```
