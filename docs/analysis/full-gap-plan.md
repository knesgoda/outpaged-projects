# OutPaged Project Management Deep Dive & Delivery Plan

## 1. Current Implementation Inventory

### 1.1 Application Shell and Providers
- The React entry point wraps the router with stacked providers for authentication, profile, workspace, security, accessibility, marketing, operations, releases, Slack, theme, query caching, and command palette, but no global error handling, feature flagging, or performance telemetry is wired in yet.【F:src/App.tsx†L2-L74】
- Routing mounts a large menu of pages beneath a single `AppLayout`, but every route resolves to client-side React pages without server-side data loaders, role guards, or workspace scoping. Many routes only surface placeholder copy with no dynamic data source attached.【F:src/routes.tsx†L1-L149】
- The shared layout renders a sidebar/topbar frame with keyboard shortcut helpers. Responsive shell behavior and help shortcuts are present, yet there is no real-time presence indicator, focus mode, or notification drawer integration despite the specification calling for collaboration-first UX.【F:src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx†L1-L112】

### 1.2 Supabase Integration and Data Access
- Supabase client bootstrap reads environment variables and falls back to a hardcoded project, returning stubs when env vars are missing. There is no per-workspace tenant routing, no RLS schema documentation, and no abstraction for multi-environment deployments.【F:src/integrations/supabase/client.ts†L1-L156】
- Project service helpers expose CRUD over a single `projects` table. Filtering, pagination, and simple status fields exist, but there are no joins to workspaces, no hierarchy (programs/epics), no rollups, and no auditing hooks.【F:src/services/projects.ts†L1-L198】
- Hooks like `useProjects` and `useTaskAssignees` coordinate optimistic updates and notification side effects, yet they only cover a sliver of the data model (projects and task assignees) without generalizing to the richer hierarchy (workspaces, boards, items, subitems, dependencies) demanded by the product spec.【F:src/hooks/useProjects.ts†L1-L209】【F:src/hooks/useTaskAssignees.tsx†L1-L199】

### 1.3 Task Management Surfaces
- The Tasks page loads items from Supabase with limited fields, enriches them with assignee profiles, and renders lightweight cards. It lacks subitems, dependency management, workflows, time tracking, SLA states, or sprint allocation logic. Actions for edit/delete open dialogs but do not orchestrate workflow transitions or validations.【F:src/pages/Tasks.tsx†L1-L240】
- Kanban components provide drag-and-drop columns with WIP limit badges, yet they operate on in-memory arrays. There is no persistence of board configurations, swimlanes, or cross-board relations, nor real-time sync or server-driven constraint enforcement.【F:src/components/kanban/KanbanColumn.tsx†L1-L115】
- Automation UI exposes a rule builder with trigger/action pickers, but no execution engine, schedule processing, or audit logs exist to back it. There is no validation of conflicting rules or support for project/board scopes.【F:src/components/automation/AutomationRuleBuilder.tsx†L1-L200】

### 1.4 Collaboration, Knowledge, and Reporting
- Inbox, documents, analytics, roadmap, and other directories exist, but most pages show static placeholders. There is no evidence of threaded comments, knowledge base search, dashboards, or reporting engines that align with the vision’s emphasis on data-first workflows.
- Providers for accessibility, security, marketing, operations, and releases wrap the app, yet their implementations are stubs (no policy enforcement, incident response, or release management wiring). These need to be expanded into functional modules.

### 1.5 Governance and Administration
- Admin routes surface workspace settings, permissions, security, audit logs, API explorer, and billing pages, but there is no backing policy model, no RLS-driven role enforcement, and no integrations for SSO, SCIM, or compliance reporting. The security provider currently only gates UI affordances.

### 1.6 Testing and Quality Barriers
- Jest configuration exists, yet there is limited coverage of critical flows (authentication, project CRUD, task workflows). There are no integration tests for Supabase functions or automation recipes. Accessibility and performance budgets are not enforced in CI.

## 2. Gap Analysis vs Product Vision

| Vision Pillar | Required Capabilities | Current State | Gap Summary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unified hierarchy (Org → Workspace → Project → Board → Item → Subitem) | Multi-tenant schema, scoped APIs, hierarchy navigation, cross-linking | Only projects/tasks tables referenced; no workspace/org schema in code | Build complete hierarchy with RLS, relationships, and UI controls |
| Configurable workflows and fields | Workflow designer, dynamic fields, formula/rollup/mirror columns | Static fields baked into components; no designer UI or dynamic rendering | Introduce metadata-driven schema with runtime form/view rendering |
| Agile/ITSM toolchain | Sprints, backlog grooming, capacity, SLAs, incident/change workflows | No sprint entities, backlog view, or SLA timers | Implement sprint + service management modules with timers and metrics |
| Automation engine | Trigger-condition-action builder with execution logs | UI stub only; no processing engine, scheduling, or audit | Build backend worker, queue, logs, and governance guardrails |
| Intake/forms & approvals | Public forms, routing, multi-step approvals, SLA policies | No form builder, approvals engine, or SLA tracking | Create form designer, routing rules, approval states, SLA timers |
| Collaboration layer | Comments, threads, presence, notifications, meeting notes | Basic notifications via `createNotification`; no threads or presence | Deliver collaborative services (comments, watchers, inbox) with real-time sync |
| Reporting & analytics | Dashboards, KPI library, drill-down, schedule exports | No analytics engine; only static placeholders | Build analytics data mart, visualization components, scheduler |
| Portfolio & OKRs | Programs, objectives, roadmaps, scenario planning | Not represented; only generic project list | Add portfolio objects, OKR tracking, scenario planner |
| Integrations | Git, CI/CD, Slack/Teams, calendars, CRM, imports | Only Slack provider stub; no integration workflows | Implement integration connectors, syncing, and monitoring |
| Security & governance | Roles, custom permissions, field-level security, audit, compliance | UI stubs without enforcement, no audit/event logs | Implement policy engine, audit logging, compliance tooling |
| Performance & scale | Virtualized boards, real-time sync, sharding, background jobs | Static UI lists, no sharding or background processing | Introduce scalable architecture (websocket sync, workers, partitioning) |

## 3. Delivery Blueprint for Full Functionality

### Phase 0: Foundational Architecture
1. **Schema & Supabase Setup**
   - Model organizations, workspaces, projects, boards, items, subitems, workflows, fields, automations, notifications, audits, time tracking, and permissions tables with RLS policies aligning to roles.
   - Configure Supabase edge functions for heavy operations (automation execution, reporting aggregates) and background queues (e.g., task timers, SLA breaches).
2. **Domain SDK**
   - Replace direct Supabase calls with a domain SDK that enforces multi-tenant scoping, caching, and telemetry. Provide typed queries per domain entity.
3. **Event Bus & Audit Logging**
   - Introduce an event emitter layer to capture user actions (create/update/delete/transition) and feed audit logs, notifications, and integrations simultaneously.
4. **Auth & Security Hardening**
   - Implement role-based guards, field-level controls, and session management (MFA, SSO hooks, SCIM provisioning). Extend `SecurityProvider` to enforce policy decisions client-side backed by Supabase RLS.

### Phase 1: Core Work Management
1. **Hierarchy Navigation**
   - Build workspace switcher, project dashboards, board list, and item detail pages that navigate the full hierarchy with breadcrumbs and cross-links.
   - Implement subitems, dependencies, relations, components, and versioning with dedicated UIs and visual indicators.
2. **Dynamic Fields & Views**
   - Create a field registry and form/view renderer that reads workspace/project configuration to render dynamic columns (single/multi select, formula, rollup, mirror, timeline, etc.).
   - Persist board configurations (columns, swimlanes, WIP limits, filters) and implement server-driven validation of WIP and dependency constraints.
3. **Workflow Designer & Execution**
   - Deliver a visual workflow builder that manipulates state machines per item type. Enforce transition validators/post-functions using edge functions and UI gating.
   - Wire status transitions into the task dialog and Kanban moves, ensuring required fields and automations fire.
4. **Collaboration & Notifications**
   - Implement threaded comments, mentions, watchers, and inbox views backed by Supabase real-time channels. Extend notifications to email/Slack with preferences and digest scheduling.

### Phase 2: Agile, ITSM, and Operations
1. **Agile Tooling**
   - Add backlog grooming, sprint planning, capacity, and reporting (velocity, burn-down/up, CFD). Introduce estimation (points/time), story hierarchies, and spillover handling.
   - Build sprint board view with WIP indicators, burn charts, and commit/carryover analytics.
2. **ITSM & SLA**
   - Model incidents, problems, changes, SLAs, and timers. Provide intake queues, SLA pause/resume logic, approvals, and escalation workflows.
   - Surface dashboards for MTTR, SLA compliance, and incident timelines.
3. **Time & Resource Management**
   - Implement timers, timesheets, approvals, and export tooling. Build workload view across projects with capacity rules, PTO calendars, and skill-based matching.
4. **Documents & Knowledge**
   - Ship doc editor with collaboration (live cursors, presence), knowledge base with categories and versioning, and whiteboards with item conversion.

### Phase 3: Automation, Integrations, and Analytics
1. **Automation Engine**
   - Build drag-and-drop rule builder backed by a rules service. Support triggers, conditions, actions, scheduling, conflict detection, and execution logs with retry policies.
   - Provide recipe library, environment guardrails (limits per tier), and audit trails.
2. **Integrations Platform**
   - Implement connectors for Git providers, CI/CD, Slack/Teams, calendars, support desks, CRM, and imports. Each connector should handle auth, mapping, sync jobs, and error handling dashboards.
   - Provide outbound webhooks, API tokens, and GraphQL explorer with rate limit management.
3. **Reporting & Analytics**
   - Create data mart tables (facts/dimensions) and a query builder UI for dashboards. Support KPI tiles, charts, drill-through, scheduled exports, and alerting on thresholds.
   - Integrate portfolio/program/OKR layers with roadmap timelines, risk registers, and scenario planning simulations.

### Phase 4: Governance, Compliance, and Experience Polish
1. **Permissions & Governance**
   - Build custom role designer, field-level security, project privacy, guest access, and change control workflows. Enforce via Supabase policies and client capability checks.
   - Provide audit trails with retention policies, export, and admin analytics for usage.
2. **Performance & Scale**
   - Introduce list virtualization, server-side pagination, delta sync, optimistic concurrency, and conflict resolution. Support sharding by workspace and background processing for heavy jobs.
3. **Accessibility & Internationalization**
   - Audit components for WCAG AA compliance, add localization framework with per-user locale settings, and ensure keyboard/screen reader support across custom controls.
4. **Mobile/Desktop Clients**
   - Deliver responsive PWA improvements, offline caching, and wrappers for native apps with notifications, quick capture, and deep linking.

### Phase 5: Quality, Testing, and Launch Readiness
1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Expand unit, integration, and end-to-end coverage across domains. Add contract tests for Supabase functions and mocked third-party integrations.
   - Integrate accessibility (axe), performance (Lighthouse), and visual regression tests in CI.
2. **Observability**
   - Instrument tracing, metrics, and structured logging for frontend/backed workflows. Monitor automation runs, integration health, and SLA timers.
3. **Migration & Templates**
   - Build template library provisioning scripts, migration tooling for CSV/Jira/Monday imports with validation/dry-run support.
4. **Documentation & Enablement**
   - Author in-app guides, admin handbooks, API docs, and release notes. Ensure change management with Definition of Ready/Done checklists and guardrails.

## 4. Sequencing & Risks
- **Sequencing**: Complete Phase 0 before layering feature work; subsequent phases can overlap with dedicated squads (core work management, agile/ITSM, automation/integrations, governance/scale).
- **Key Risks**: Multi-tenant complexity, automation reliability, integration maintenance, and analytics performance. Mitigate with feature flagging, incremental rollout, canary workspaces, and strong observability.
- **Success Metrics**: Board load <200ms, automation success >99%, SLA breach detection <1 min, reporting query P95 <3s, WCAG AA compliance verified quarterly.

This blueprint transforms the current prototype into the all-in-one project management platform described in the vision, addressing every domain with phased, testable delivery milestones.
