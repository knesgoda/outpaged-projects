# Implementation Plan for Requested Features

The requested changes span several major areas of the product (Kanban board, Timeline/Gantt views,
board configuration flows, and automated tests). Completing all items will require a multi-phase
approach touching front-end components, board domain logic, and E2E automation suites. Below is an
outline of the recommended plan to deliver the features safely:

## 1. Kanban Enhancements
- Extend column metadata to expose whether a column is operating under a WIP override so the column
  header can adopt an error (red) state while the override is active.
- Update the override modal to check the active user's permissions before allowing the confirmation
  action. Block the confirm button and surface an explanatory message when permission is missing.
- Introduce a keyboard handler (triggered via the `'` key) that cycles a task's status. The handler
  should respect WIP guard evaluations before applying status transitions.

## 2. Timeline & Gantt Enhancements
- Add dependency creation affordances in both timeline and Gantt views with UI controls to accept
  lead/lag offsets. Persist the offsets as part of the relation metadata.
- Expose baseline date ranges and critical path styling toggles. Update export flows to include the
  additional metadata.

## 3. Board Management Improvements
- Implement dialogs for configuring mirrored columns and ensure epic rollups display aggregated
  metrics. Support combination logic for quick filter chips and routing of form submissions to board
  groups.
- Provide bulk sprint move utilities, group archive state tracking, and a schema-only board copy
  option that duplicates structure without instance data.

## 4. Testing Strategy
- Create unit tests covering WIP override rendering, permission enforcement, keyboard navigation,
  dependency offset validation, baseline & critical path calculations, and board management helpers.
- Author Cypress E2E specs to validate override flows, dependency linking, mirror column dialogs,
  bulk sprint moves, and archive/copy behaviors end-to-end.

## Delivery Approach
1. **Discovery & Design** – Audit existing data models and design UX flows for each enhancement.
2. **Incremental Implementation** – Ship features in vertical slices (Kanban, Timeline/Gantt, Board
   management) to reduce risk and enable focused review.
3. **Testing & Automation** – Expand Jest and Cypress coverage alongside each feature change.
4. **Documentation & Training** – Update user guides and internal runbooks once functionality is
   complete.

This plan enables parallelization while ensuring that architectural and UX considerations remain
aligned across the board and timeline surfaces.
